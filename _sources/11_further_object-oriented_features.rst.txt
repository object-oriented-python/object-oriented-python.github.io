    abstract class
        A class designed only to be the :term:`parent <parent class>` of other
        classes, and never to be instantiated itself. Abstract classes often
        define the interfaces of :term:`methods <method>` but leave their implementations
        to the concrete :term:`child classes <child class>`.

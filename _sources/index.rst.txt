This is the online textbook for MATH50009 Principles of Programming, a second
year object oriented programming module offered to mathematics undergraduates at
Imperial College London. This module will run for the first time starting in
January 2021, so the material is still very much in development. Feel free to
use this material to learn object-oriented programming in Python. I would be
very interested to hear from anyone interested in using it to teach.

This is the online textbook for MATH50009 Principles of Programming, a second
year object oriented programming module offered to mathematics undergraduates at
Imperial College London. Read the introductory chapter for information on how to
go about doing the module week by week.

If you're not taking the module at Imperial, you should nonetheless feel free to
use this material to learn object-oriented programming in Python. I would be
very interested to hear from anyone interested in using it to teach.

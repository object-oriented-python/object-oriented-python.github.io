<h1>How to do this course<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-do-this-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Programming, like mathematics, is a practical, problem solving discipline. It’s
not possible to learn to program just by reading notes and watching lectures. To
learn to program you need to put the content of the course into practice by
writing code. The structure of this course is designed to help you to really
understand new concepts in programming by putting them into practice. Each week,
we run through the same cycle:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Read the notes</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the videos</p></li>
<li><p>Do the quiz</p></li>
<li><p>Write the code</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="the-notes">
<h2>The notes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the new material we cover in this course is presented in these notes.
Each chapter contains the material for one week of term, so in week <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>,
you work through chapter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>. The notes always the starting point for your work.
Each chapter will introduce new concepts in programming, often tied back to
related mathematical concepts, and always illustrated by practical code
examples. Python has excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/">official online documentation</a>, and we link to that throughout the text.
External links show up in orange while <a class="reference internal" href="1_introduction.html#introduction"><span class="std std-ref">internal links to other parts of
the notes</span></a> are red. Sometimes we introduce counterexamples:
illustrations of code errors or bad implementation ideas. These will be flagged
with a big red cross:</p>
<div class="badcode docutils container">
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Conversely, if it’s necessary in context to highlight which approach is the
correct one, the code will come with a big green tick:</p>
<div class="goodcode docutils container">
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the end of each chapter there is a glossary containing key new concepts
introduced in that chapter. Always check the glossary and convince yourself that
you understand all the terms introduced there, this is a good check on whether
you have understood the chapter as a whole. However, there is more to learning
new concepts than just the vocabulary, so don’t be tempted to skip reading the
chapter and just jump to the glossary!</p>
<p>The chapters broadly alternate between introducing new programming concepts,
such as <a class="reference internal" href="3_objects.html#objects"><span class="std std-ref">objects</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="5_abstract_data_types.html#abstract-data-types"><span class="std std-ref">abstract data types</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="7_inheritance.html#inheritance"><span class="std std-ref">inheritance</span></a>, and
covering various aspects of the craft of programming, such as <a class="reference internal" href="7_inheritance.html#inheritance"><span class="std std-ref">style</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="8_debugging.html#debugging"><span class="std std-ref">debugging</span></a>. In this way the course combines specific programming knowledge
with more general coding skills.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-videos">
<h2>The videos<a class="headerlink" href="#the-videos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the notes are links to videos. These aren’t typical lecture videos in
that they’re not primarily focussed on delivering the new ideas in the course.
In particular, the videos don’t set out to duplicate the delivery of the
material in the notes. Instead, the videos focus on putting the concepts into
practice, often by showing live coding sessions. Usually you’ll want to watch
the video for a given section <em>after</em> reading the corresponding notes.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-quizzes">
<h2>The quizzes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-quizzes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Towards the end of each chapter is a link back to a quiz on Imperial’s
Blackboard system. The quizzes are designed to allow you to convince yourself
that you’ve understood the material in the chapter. Sometimes they will simply
be multiple choice questions testing your understanding of the material, but
sometimes you will need to open up Python and try things out in order to work
out the right answer. The quizzes do not contribute to your module grade, but how
well you are doing on them is an indication of your progress on the module.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-exercises">
<h2>The exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#the-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we’ve already noted, really learning to program better is only achieved by
writing code. The core of each week’s activities is therefore to put the new
concepts and programming structures you’ve learned into practice. The
programming exercises are given at the end of each chapter, just before the
glossary. Each time there will be a skeleton code available from
<a class="reference external" href="https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/git.html#github-classroom-exercise" title="(in Installation instructions for FoNS v2020.0)"><span class="xref std std-ref">GitHub Classroom</span></a> which provides the starting
point. Sometimes you might be asked to complete a piece of code while on other
occasions you’ll need to write a whole Python module from scratch. Each set of
exercises will come with a matching set of tests. These are small programs which
check whether your code produces the correct responses to a range of inputs.
Tests like this provide immediate feedback and enable you to know how you are
doing without having to wait for code to be submitted and marked.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Solutions to exercises will not be issued. The notes and accompanying
example code contain examples of the same programming constructs that the
exercises require you to implement, and the tests provide a mechanism to
know when you have a correct answer. There are also help mechanisms via the
course forum and the lab sessions. Issuing solutions to problems would
simply encourage students to study the solutions rather than write code, and
the only way to learn to program is to write code.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="assessment">
<h2>Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The weekly quiz and exercises are not assessable: they are formative activities
designed to help you learn the module. Instead, the module will be assessed by
two controlled programming assessments, effectively programming exams. The first
programming assessment will be held in week 7 and will be worth 20% of the
marks for the course. This provides an opportunity to receive feedback in the
middle of the term, and is a practice for the main exam. The <a class="reference internal" href="#midterm"><span class="std std-ref">course contents for
week 7</span></a> will comprise practice programming exercises for this midterm test.
The second programming assessment will be held in the main May exam period and
will count for the other 80% of the course.</p>
<p>The instructions and skeleton code for the programming exercises will be
released at a fixed time on GitHub Classroom, and the code which you have
committed to GitHub by the end of the allotted time will be marked.</p>
<p>The exam questions will be similar to the weekly exercises in the course,
and may include new programmes to write from specification, modifications or
extensions to be made to code which is provided, and debugging exercises in
which defective code is provided which you need to correct. Marks will be
allocated both for the functional correctness of the code written, and for
good style and following Python coding conventions.</p>
<section id="midterm-test-preparation">
<span id="midterm"></span><h3>Midterm test preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#midterm-test-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This week you will take a programming test worth 20% of the course. The format
of this test is deliberately similar to the programming exam in May that makes
up the other 80% of the assessment. This test therefore provides both some feedback
on how you are progressing in the course, and an opportunity to practice for the
end of term exam. This is a programming module, so the midterm test will consist
of programming exercises. The content which will be examined in the test is
everything covered up to and including week 6. There won’t be any new concepts
introduced during the test, however the questions may suggest that you use
Python modules, classes, or functions that haven’t previously been introduced in
the course. These will always be similar in character to ones that have
previously been mentioned, and the test instructions will explicitly link to the
Python documentation for any features they suggest.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="test-format">
<h1>Test format<a class="headerlink" href="#test-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The final exam will be two hours long and comprise 4 questions, each of which
will be marked out of 20. The midterm test will be 40 minutes long, so to keep
the question format consistent with the final exam, there will a single
question. The extra 10 minutes is to give you some flexibility, because in the
final exam you could spend more time on some questions than others. The
question will be subdivided into identified parts with a specified number of
marks associated with each.</p>
<p>The test will work using GitHub Classroom. The link to accept the test
“assignment” will be distributed at the start time of the test, simultaneously in the
course Teams channel, by email, and in the Piazza forum. The test repository
will contain a file <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.rst</span></code> containing the questions, skeleton code
appropriate to the questions, and tests. GitHub shows <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.rst</span></code> files on
the repository web page, and the instructions will be easier to read there since
any links will be clickable.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-mark-scheme">
<h1>The mark scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mark-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Of the 20 marks for each question, 4 will be explicitly for basic style. 2 marks
will be for passing flake8 with no errors. If there are only a handful of minor
flake8 errors then you will receive 1 mark, and if there are more than that you
will receive 0. flake8 is an imperfect tool, so the marker will check the output
of flake8 and disregard any false positives. The other 2 marks will be allocated
on a similar basis for basic style matters that flake8 cannot check, such as
conforming with naming conventions and commenting appropriately.</p>
<p>The remaining 16 marks will be allocated to the various parts of the questions. As with a
written maths test, getting the correct final answer is necessary but not
sufficient. A full marks answer to a question will be functionally correct, have
optimal <a class="reference internal" href="5_abstract_data_types.html#term-algorithmic-complexity"><span class="xref std std-term">algorithmic complexity</span></a>, and be elegant and readable. The tests
provided are an aid to writing correct code: passing the tests does not prove
that your answer is correct. For example, your code could produce the correct
output in the cases tested but nonetheless fail to implement the specification in
the question. For the avoidance of doubt, a correct answer is one which
correctly implements the specification, not simply one which passes the tests
provided.</p>
<p>As a rough guide, a solution which produced the correct output but was very
inelegantly written (for example taking many too many steps to achieve simple
functionality) and which used a suboptimal algorithm could be expected to earn
half of the marks available for a question.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-git-in-the-test">
<h1>Using git in the test<a class="headerlink" href="#using-git-in-the-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You should accept the test from GitHub classroom, and clone the test repository
into the folder you created for the course, just like you have been doing for
the exercise repositories. This will help ensure that you are programming in
the same environment you have been using all along, and therefore avoid any
unfortunate misconfiguration surprises in the test.</p>
<p>This is a test of programming as a whole, so using git correctly is a part of
the test. This has some consequences for how you should go about the test:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Commit <em>and</em> push your work as you go along. Do not rely on committing once
at the end of the test. You will be marked on what you have pushed to GitHub
at the end of the test period. If the first time that you try to push
something to GitHub is at the end of the test time, and something goes wrong, then
you will receive 0% for the test, because you will not have pushed any
answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t forget to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> any files you need to create. If you don’t add them
to the repository, they won’t be pushed and therefore they won’t be marked.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If you commit and push often as you go through the test then not only will
you know that you have some marks in the bank already, but you will have a
record of what you had done at each point in time. In the unlikely event of a failure outside your
control, such as your network failing or GitHub going down, it will be very
easy to assign the correct marks to students who have already pushed a large
part of their work to GitHub. At the other extreme, it will be difficult to
ascribe any credit at all to students with no pushed work who then push a
single commit to GitHub after the time has expired.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="preparing-for-the-test">
<h1>Preparing for the test<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-for-the-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The way to prepare for the test is to program. In the first instance, you should
make sure you have completed all of the programming exercises for the previous
weeks. Ensure that you can run and pass all the tests locally on your machine,
and also ensure that you have pushed everything to GitHub and that the tests
show as passing there.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gone through the previous exercises, you should attempt the practice
questions here. Each of these is a question similar in format and length to the
questions on the exam. Just like on the exam, the question is specified in the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.rst</span></code> file in the exercise repository. When you first attempt each
of these exercises, you should set yourself a 40 minute timer and see what you
can get done (and committed and pushed!) in the time you would have in the test.
After that, if you haven’t finished, then go on and finish the exercise.
Programming is a practical discipline, and finishing one exercise will make you
faster and more capable when you attempt the next one.</p>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="exam-preparation">
<h1>Exam preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#exam-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The exam will be similar in format to the <a class="reference internal" href="#midterm"><span class="std std-ref">midterm test</span></a>, so all
of the advice about preparing applies there too. As with all second year
elective modules, the exam will comprise four questions, each marked out of 20.</p>
<p>As with everything in this course, the one thing you can do to effectively
prepare for the exam is to program. You should complete any of the exercises in
the course that you have not yet done, and more exercises are given below.</p>
<p>Everything we have covered in the course up to and including week 10 will be
fully examinable. The week 11 material is not examinable with the
following exceptions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>You may need to use <a class="reference internal" href="10_further_object-oriented_features.html#term-abstract-base-class"><span class="xref std std-term">abstract base classes</span></a> from
the standard library to check the type of variables. This is simply what you
have been doing all term, for example using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Number" title="(in Python v3.10)"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numbers.Number</span></code></a> to check
that a value is numeric.</p></li>
<li><p>The skeleton code may include <a class="reference internal" href="10_further_object-oriented_features.html#term-abstract-base-class"><span class="xref std std-term">abstract base classes</span></a> from which your classes may need to inherit. This is actually a help
to you in the exam, because the <a class="reference internal" href="10_further_object-oriented_features.html#term-abstract-method"><span class="xref std std-term">abstract methods</span></a>
will provide information about what you need to implement, and a helpful
error message if you haven’t done so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The module Piazza forum will remain open throughout the revision period and we
will be very happy to respond to your questions. There will also be a live
revision session during week 1 of summer term in the module team. This will be
an opportunity to ask individual questions just like in the labs. If enough
people attend then I will also run a group Q &amp; A session.</p>
<p>Some specifically-designed practice questions are presented below. In addition to this, there are a lot of very good exercises in
chapters 7 and 9 of <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-662-49887-3">Hans Petter Langtangen, A Primer on Scientific Programming
with Python</a>.
You can access that book by logging in with your Imperial credentials.</p>
<p>The first two questions are in exam format.</p>

you need to do is practice programming, and cutting out material
doesn’t help with that. Marks are not given as the question is the
wrong length, so dividing 20 marks over the question would just be
misleading</p>
</div>
</div></div><p>In addition to these exam-style questions, you can also usefully practice
programming by going beyond the specification of the exercises in the course.

in a manner analogous to integer division. You might also implement

<p>Don’t forget that repeating code is poor style, so you might need a
helper method to implement the actual polynomial division.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>The exam will start at 0900 UTC (London time) on Monday 24 May 2021 and will run for
2 hours. Students with additional time will be contacted about this separately.</p></li>
<li><p>The exam will take the form of a GitHub classroom assignment, just like all of
the exercises. The URL to accept the assignment will be posted at the start
of the exam on the <a class="reference external" href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ae96b9a199b15419281f55f454d240249%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=1b12939c-d8c9-4e4d-a291-0ff35d57869f&amp;tenantId=2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307">module Team</a>, as Blackboard announcement, and posted on
Piazza. Of these, the Team is the most instant form of communication so you
are advised to look there and use the other sources as a backup.</p></li>
<li><p>The exam instructions are in the <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> in the repository.
GitHub will show this to you on the repository website. The instructions
are very similar to those for the practice problems above, so you should
make sure you have tried those in advance of the exam.</p></li>
<li><p>There are 4 questions, each marked out of 20 marks. The exam is marked out
of 80 and your attempts at all four questions will count.</p></li>
<li><p>You submit your work by committing and pushing to the repository on GitHub
created when you accept the GitHub Classroom assignment. You must commit as
you go along, and it is strongly advisable to also push as you go. <strong>Only commits
made during the exam period will count.</strong> Please note that you do not need a
network connection in order to commit, so you can still do so even if you have
network problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The upload time at the end of the exam is only there to enable you to push
your work. <strong>Commits made during the upload time will not be marked.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you have a problem during the exam, you should post a question
<a class="reference external" href="https://piazza.com/class/kjob8in6eox1bp">on Piazza</a>. During the exam,
Piazza will be configured so that student posts can only be seen by the
instructors. Other than this difference you should follow <a class="reference external" href="_static/If_you_have_a_problem.pdf">the instructions
on what to do in case of problems</a>
provided by the maths exams office in their
email of 11 February. In particular, if those instructions require you to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:maths&#46;exams&#37;&#52;&#48;imperial&#46;ac&#46;uk">email the exam team</a> after the exam
then you should do so. Posting on Piazza is only a mechanism for getting
immediate help during the exam.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a problem during the exam which prevents you from working, for
example you cannot clone the repository or your computer crashes,  then you
should do the following:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Take note of the time when the problem starts.</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, post <a class="reference external" href="https://piazza.com/class/kjob8in6eox1bp">on Piazza</a> to ask for help.
If you cannot immediately post on Piazza, do so as soon as you are able. This establishes
an external record of your issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Take note of the time when you are able to resume work.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you commit your work before the published end time of the exam.</p></li>
<li><p>Having committed (and, if at all possible, pushed), continue to work past the end time of the
exam, committing at least every 5 minutes until you have recovered the time you lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Straight after the exam submit a mitigating circumstances claim explaining the situation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is critical that you have committed your work before the end of the original exam time, because
no commitments can be made during the exam that late work will be accepted. This will be decided in
the light of the mitigating circumstances claim.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The usual <a class="reference external" href="_static/Academic_Integrity.pdf">academic integrity rules for remote assessments</a>
apply. In
particular, you may consult any resource published on the internet, but you may
not seek help from anyone else, whether in person, by email, chat message,
forum post or any other means.</p></li>

<span id="midterm"></span><h1>Midterm test preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#midterm-test-preparation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The midterm programming test is worth 20% of the course. The format
of this test is deliberately similar to the programming exam in May that makes
up the other 80% of the assessment. This test therefore provides both some feedback
on how you are progressing in the course, and an opportunity to practice for the
end of term exam. This is a programming module, so the midterm test will consist
of programming exercises. The content which will be examined in the test is
everything covered up to and including chapter 6. There won’t be any new concepts
introduced during the test, however the questions may suggest that you use
Python modules, classes, or functions that haven’t previously been introduced in
the course. These will always be similar in character to ones that have
previously been mentioned, and the test instructions will explicitly link to the
Python documentation for any features they suggest.</p>
<section id="test-format">
<h2>Test format<a class="headerlink" href="#test-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final exam will be two hours long and comprise 4 questions, each of which
will be marked out of 20. The midterm test will be 40 minutes long, so to keep
the question format consistent with the final exam, there will a single
question. The extra 10 minutes is to give you some flexibility, because in the
final exam you could spend more time on some questions than others. The
question will be subdivided into identified parts with a specified number of
marks associated with each.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-mark-scheme">
<h2>The mark scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mark-scheme" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of the 20 marks for each question, 4 will be explicitly for basic style. 2 marks
will be for passing flake8 with no errors. If there are only a handful of minor
flake8 errors then you will receive 1 mark, and if there are more than that you
will receive 0. flake8 is an imperfect tool, so the marker will check the output
of flake8 and disregard any false positives. The other 2 marks will be allocated
on a similar basis for basic style matters that flake8 cannot check, such as
conforming with naming conventions and commenting appropriately.</p>
<p>The remaining 16 marks will be allocated to the various parts of the questions. As with a
written maths test, getting the correct final answer is necessary but not
sufficient. A full marks answer to a question will be functionally correct, have
optimal <a class="reference internal" href="5_abstract_data_types.html#term-algorithmic-complexity"><span class="xref std std-term">algorithmic complexity</span></a>, and be elegant and readable. The tests
provided are an aid to writing correct code: passing the tests does not prove
that your answer is correct. For example, your code could produce the correct
output in the cases tested but nonetheless fail to implement the specification in
the question. For the avoidance of doubt, a correct answer is one which
correctly implements the specification, not simply one which passes the tests
provided.</p>
<p>As a rough guide, a solution which produced the correct output but was very
inelegantly written (for example taking many too many steps to achieve simple
functionality) and which used a suboptimal algorithm could be expected to earn
half of the marks available for a question.</p>
</section>
<section id="preparing-for-the-test">
<h2>Preparing for the test<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-for-the-test" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The way to prepare for the test is to program. In the first instance, you should
make sure you have completed all of the programming exercises for the previous
weeks. Ensure that you can run and pass all the tests locally on your machine,
and also ensure that you have pushed everything to GitHub and that the tests
show as passing there.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gone through the previous exercises, you should attempt the practice
questions here. Each of these is a question similar in format and length to the
questions on the exam. Just like on the exam, the question is specified in the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.rst</span></code> file in the exercise repository. When you first attempt each
of these exercises, you should set yourself a 40 minute timer and see what you
can get done (and committed and pushed!) in the time you would have in the test.
After that, if you haven’t finished, then go on and finish the exercise.
Programming is a practical discipline, and finishing one exercise will make you
faster and more capable when you attempt the next one.</p>
